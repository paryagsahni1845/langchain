# Exploring LangChain

This repository is my playground for exploring **LangChain**.  
Iâ€™m experimenting with:  
- Loading data from sources like Wikipedia  
- Splitting long text into meaningful chunks  
- Preparing documents for retrieval and question-answering tasks  

The goal is to understand the basics of **document processing** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipelines, while building small experiments and practical examples.
